Introducing our cutting-edge mobile application designed to streamline the management of personal protective equipment (PPE) for operators in specific work areas. Our app enables operators to easily register and track their PPE, ensuring that they have all the necessary gear to safely perform their tasks. The app is customized for different work areas, allowing for efficient management of PPE requirements based on specific job responsibilities.

With our app, operators can easily input and update their PPE inventory, keeping track of what they have and what they need. The app automatically generates a permit for operators who have all the required PPE, allowing them to work without delay. For those who do not have the necessary PPE, the app provides real-time notifications and alerts, ensuring compliance with safety regulations.

The app also includes features for administrators to oversee and manage PPE compliance for their team. Administrators can easily view the PPE status of each operator, generate reports, and monitor overall compliance. The app also provides reminders for upcoming PPE expiration dates, ensuring that operators have up-to-date gear at all times.

Our app is user-friendly, with a simple and intuitive interface that makes it easy for operators and administrators alike to use. It is available on both iOS and Android platforms, providing flexibility and accessibility for all users. Our app is the ultimate tool for efficient and effective PPE management, ensuring the safety and compliance of operators in specific work areas.

The app uses need an ApiRes that is a private repo, and was built in kotlin.
